# About the Project

This is a Unity 2021.1.16f1 project of a Snake game. The Player can compete with two different AIs: one trained with Deep Learning and another trained with Deep Reinforcement Learning. Both AIs were created with Tensorflow but distilled in two simple dictionaries (although the API to call the original models are in the auxiliary_files folder). This distillation process is not always possible, but in this case, it was simply due to how both networks were made. Making all the Tensorflow network knowledge into dictionaries made us avoid unnecessary API calls. Also, we do not rely on prediction latency (yes, I am a little proud of this distillation process in particular). 

The game has an onboarding to explain to the Player the components. The onboard is both in English and American Sign Language (using the Hugo translator from Hand Talk free App). After the onboard, there is a menu where the Player chooses what snake they want to go against. A little detail about the soundtrack: It is also generated by AI!

Thank you, and please enjoy the project.
