#About the Project
This is a Unity 2021.1.16f1 project of a Snake game that the Player can compete with two diferent AIs: one trained with Deep Learning and another traned with Deep Reinforcement Learning. Both AIs were created with Tensorflow, but distilled in two simple dictionaries (altoght the API to call the original models are in the auxiliary_files folder). This distillation process is not aways possible, but in this case was simple due the way that both networks were made. Making all the Tensorflow network knowledge into dictionaries made us avoid unecessary API calls and dont rely in prediction latency (yes, I am a little proud of this distillation process in particular). 

The game has a onboarding to explain the player the components. The onboard is both in English and in American Sign Language (using the Hugo translator from Hand Talk free App). After the onboard there is a menu where the player chooses what snake they want to go against. A little detail about the soundtrack: It is also generated by AI!

Thank you and please enjoy the project.
